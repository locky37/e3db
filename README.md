# e3db Command Line Interface

This repository contains an updated CLI for Tozny E3DB. It
supports a (growing) subset of commands from the Scala client,
and tries to be compatible when it makes sense.

# Installation

```shell
$ go get github.com/tozny/e3db-cli
```

# Running

Use the `--help` option to see what subcommands are available:

```shell
$ e3db-cli --help
```
